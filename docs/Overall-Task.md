# OVERALL TASK
---------------

I require a “Material-designed” app that has the following functionalities :

## Login Page

- not everyone is invited to all functions.
- Login requires : name and / or mobile number.
- A mapping exists at the web-server that controls what schedule a person gets to see.

## Schedule tab

- displays the schedule of the events
- Integration with maps : best way to reach the venue from current location (use Google Maps)
- login based display

## Gallery tab

- special behind the scene videos and pictures for the guests. which can be seen anytime
- accessible to all
- has a floating “UPLOAD” widget (same as how the material-design version of Gmail / Drive shows)
- guests could upload pictures and videos
- an admin goes through the pictures and videos before allowing them to show up in “Gallery Tab” of other phones.

## About us tab

- A web page that contains details about the organizers. The text and pictures will be provided by me.


## Navigation Drawer

- Donate for a cause (we will link this to a social noble cause which we will create on milaap / equivalent portal and people could donate there if they want to)

- Contact US:
- phone numbers of the organizers (data will be provided by me)

- Recent notifications:

- GCM notifications are planned to be sent once the site admin allows new pictures and videos. This menu option when clicked opens a page that displays the notifications that have been received till now.


__NOTE__ : This app is for an upcoming family event, and will NOT make it to Play Store. However, full rights to publicize this work will be allowed to the contributor.
