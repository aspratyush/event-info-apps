Weddings are unique in a way. 
Please laugh & people cry. 
Some people celebrate a new member entering 
their family while some cry letting 
go of their beloved daughters. 

Its brilliant how all these elements get together 
and create a beautiful expression of love & harmony. 
We would love to have you when we try to create 
our own little story which shall last us a lifetime....
