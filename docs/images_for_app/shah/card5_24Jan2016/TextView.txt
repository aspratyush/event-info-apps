Receptions are the biggest celebrations 
in the lives of every couple. 
It is that moment when the grooms family 
is proud of their son taking bigger responsibilities 
and starting his own family , while the brides family 
is just amazed at how quickly their daughter has grown older, 
matured and is now ready to be someones beloved wife !!Â 
Such joyous occassions dont come often. 
Please join us as we take the next step forward in our life.
